        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The <b>Symfony2 RAD Edition</b> is based on the work of the <b>KnpRadBundle</b>.</p>
        <p>Its purpose is to provide a more opinonated edition of Symfony2 than the standard one. Basically, it accelerates some processes during your development that we think are recurrents, here at KnpLabs.</p>
        <p>We believe that this is enhancements allows us to quickly prototype and deliver better tested projects.</p>
        <p>Feel free to collaborate and give us your opinion about this edition.</p>

        <h4>What happenned to the previous KnpRadBundle?</h4>
